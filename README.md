### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I possess 7+ years of experience with supporting, automating, and optimizing mission-critical application database services. I'm an engaging and results-driven business professional who has excelled in corporate, retail, customer service, restaurant, and legal sectors. I am a dependable self-starter dedicated to monitoring and analyzing infrastructure metrics, spotting any underlying issues, and correcting them before they propagate to the customer.

I became interested in data analysis because I like to troubleshoot with fellow colleagues. I realized from several presentations at work that I would like to be able to present findings that help businesses make their decisions, which reminded me why I went to college â€“ I loved doing research and learning new things. I would like to work with a company that is transparent and possess a true work life balance. I am passionate about my current career because it allows me to make an impact or difference. It helps breaks the barriers for generations to come and makes it better for the community at large.
